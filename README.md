# IOT_mesh_simulation
This is the repository for an IOT mesh simulation created in Matlab. For details, please see the paper, "Citation needed".

campus_simulatin contains the edge weight matrix (A_matrix) for the initial system set up.

The remaining files contain different routing options to simulate different levels of intelligence in the IoT mesh network.
